# Javascript Challenge

For this homework we have some Javascript challenges which will sharpen what you have learned so far. There are two assigned challenge and one bonus challenge.

For this assignment we will complete the Birthday Countdown and the Letter Count problems. 

The instructions for both of these activities are located in their respected javascript files.

In the Letter Count Challenge, you should be able to split a string of letters and then be able to count the number of specific letters within that string. 

In the Birthday Countdown, we want to be able to input a data and then have a countdown until when that date should be occurring next. 

### Bonus:

The Fibonacci Sequence is a very common math problem.
